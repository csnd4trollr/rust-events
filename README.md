## Overview

This repository is a **research and defensive reference** that documents common concepts and patterns related to inâ€‘game assist systems such as **aimbot**, **ESP**, and **wallhack** as they relate to *Rust*. The intent is to support antiâ€‘cheat research, detection-signature development, and academic analysis of rendering, inputâ€‘manipulation, and memoryâ€‘interaction patterns. The project intentionally avoids operational deployment instructions and does not include kernel drivers, exploit code, or practical bypass techniques.

---

## Research-focused features

The following features are described at a conceptual level for analysis and detection research:

* **Aimbot (analysis only)** â€” conceptual algorithms for target selection, smoothing functions, FOV calculations, and telemetry useful for building detection heuristics.
* **ESP (overlay concepts)** â€” diagrams and rendering prototypes showing how player, loot, and structure information can be represented on-screen for telemetry and UX testing.
* **Wallhack (visualization)** â€” illustrative examples describing rendering and tagging approaches used by overlays; valuable for antiâ€‘cheat pattern recognition and mitigations.
* **Triggerbot (detection examples)** â€” highâ€‘level descriptions of trigger conditions useful for generating falseâ€‘positive scenarios in detection test suites.
* **Auxiliary modules (documented conceptually)** â€” recoil compensation models, aimâ€‘prediction math, and minimap/telemetry visualizations â€” all documented for the purpose of improving defensive classifiers.

> These descriptions are intentionally non-actionable and are provided solely to help defenders and researchers reason about common cheat behaviors and detection signals.

## Ethics & legal notice

* This repository is for **defensive research, education, and security testing only**.
* Do **not** attempt to use any ideas from this repository to gain unfair advantage or to circumvent platform protections. Doing so can violate Terms of Service and local laws and can result in bans, civil liability, or criminal exposure.
* If you are performing tests for detection development, obtain written authorization and use isolated test environments.

## Configuration example (documentation only)

A non-executable `config.ini` example illustrating typical parameters used in prototyping dashboards and test harnesses.

```ini
; Documentation-only configuration (non-executable)
[Telemetry]
EnableLogging = true
SampleRateHz = 60
LogDirectory = ./logs

[Visualization]
ShowPlayerMarkers = true
ShowLootMarkers = true
MaxRenderDistance = 800

[Analysis]
EnableAnomalyDetection = true
AnomalyThreshold = 0.85
ModelPath = ./models/detector.onnx
```

---

## Development & build notes (research)

* Language & tools: Documentation and prototypes use C++/C# for rendering prototypes, and Python for analysis and ML training.
* Build systems: CMake and Visual Studio solutions provided as examples for building sanitized prototypes (no exploit code included).
* Target environment: Windows 10/11 lab machines, sandboxed and segmented from production services.
* Data handling: All telemetry should be collected, stored, and processed in accordance with privacy laws and organizational policies.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome **only** when they improve defensive capabilities, test harnesses, or academic analysis. Examples of acceptable contributions:

* Detection signatures, telemetry schemas, and annotated datasets (sanitized).
* Test harnesses that simulate benign and anomalous input/rendering patterns in a non-operational way.
* Academic write-ups on detection techniques and responsible testing methodologies.

Please avoid submitting code or instructions that enable live cheating or antiâ€‘cheat bypasses.

## Responsible disclosure

If you find a security vulnerability related to this project or thirdâ€‘party systems, contact the affected vendor (e.g., the game publisher) through their official security channels. You may also open a private, securityâ€‘labelled issue in this repository to coordinate disclosure with the maintainers.

## SEO & discoverability notes

To improve discoverability for defensive researchers and antiâ€‘cheat engineers, this README uses a set of targeted phrases such as: **Rust aimbot**, **Rust ESP**, **Rust wallhack**, **Rust Triggerbot**, and **cheat research**. For public forks focused on research, consider adding `docs/` pages (for example: `docs/detection-guides.md`, `docs/test-environments.md`) and a GitHub Pages site to index defensive materials and detection playbooks.
